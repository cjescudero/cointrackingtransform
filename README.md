# cointrackingtransform
This script processes and transforms the historical gains and losses exported from Quantfury into a format compatible with CoinTracking. It reads all Excel files from a specified directory, cleans and converts the data, and organizes it according to CoinTrackingâ€™s requirements. The script ensures that all transactions are correctly categorized as either profits or losses, includes necessary metadata, and sorts the data chronologically. Finally, it outputs the transformed data into a new Excel file with a consolidated and properly formatted trade table.
